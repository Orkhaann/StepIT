# Vite with TypeScript

Vite is a tool that provides a fast development environment for modern JavaScript and TypeScript applications. It enables you to quickly initialize, develop, and deploy your projects. Vite offers a flexible and speedy development server, compiling only the files that are being used, resulting in fast reload times.
